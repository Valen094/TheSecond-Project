<p>According to Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, "Smith sings soulful songs, but not in the usual way. Where most singers in this genre scream, he moans. While anger inspires many, Smith focuses on pain. His is the sound of a wound, a wail without defenses or shields." Jim also commented that there is something retrograde about Smith's role. Its concentration on songs of unrealizable love is reminiscent of the sad ballads of the pre-gay liberation era. The lyrics of the songs on his debut album, In the Lonely Hour (2014), address stardom, love and the man who it inspired him.2 It has been equated with Adele's 21 album, both being based on "a broken relationship".61 Smith alleges that it was brutally candidly composed for the lyrics to In the Lonely Hour.62 Despite Having received praise for its directness, its lack of diversity and the monotony of the album have also been criticized. Sheldon Pierce, for example, argues that "without a list of songs, it would be difficult to differentiate them"
